I Assume you're just going to plunk all this into a public_html or something with excessively broad permissions.
In this case, I use the .htaccess file to just deny access to everything in it.

You may only access these files through the controller.php, and then only the ones that are allowed access points.

Really, these should not be in any publically accessible folder.  The PHP includes should go to some path outside of Apache's reach with strict permissions set.
